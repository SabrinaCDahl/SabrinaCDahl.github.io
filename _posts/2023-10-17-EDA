## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)  
The overall goal for doing an EDA is determine whether there are any pitfalls within the data that will cause issues with the results created, and/or determining any patterns between the variables that could potentially lead to other hypotheses to be tested by the data.  
It is important to understand the data so results are created with intent. Checking for missing data and outliers is important so that any skew to the data can be avoided, and potentially different approaches can be used for more representative results. Also, looking at the types of variables within your dataset and understanding what makes each observation unique can help you get a better understanding of what the data is trying to convey.  
I personally find myself focusing on the univariate and bivariate visualisations and summary statistics. These help me get a grasp of the data and how it can be used, especially when looking at a new dataset. By doing so, however, I could be missing out on relationships between the data. Multivariate visualisations can be helpful, and I hope to use these more often in the future.
