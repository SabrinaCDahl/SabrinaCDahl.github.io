## Project 2 Blog Post  

This was the hardest part of the class for me so far. I attempted to create a vignette based of the USGS Earthquake Hazard program 
datasets, a free online API. The dataset defaults to use the time period within the last thirty days and I attempted to create another 
vignette for the same time period in the previous year, 2022. I then plotted the time and magnitude of the earthquakes that occurred on 
two separate scatterplots.

I learned that not all APIs are created the same. I attempted to use multiple different free APIs before realizing that they would not be 
able to efficiently support the kinds of analyses I wanted to perform. I hope that I will continue to learn and hopefully be able to approach 
this problem more confidently in the future.
