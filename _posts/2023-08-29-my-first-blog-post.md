##Data Scientists vs. Statisticians Blog Post##  

To my knowledge, I believe being a data scientist is about creating usable data from many platforms that can then be communicated to 
stakeholders and used to inform decisions in many different fields- whether that be business, marketing, or natural sciences.
The major duties or knowledge areas that would help them do this would be an expertise knowledge of their field, strong mathematical skills, 
knowledge of programming languages, data visualization skills, and communication skills. Without a knowledge of their field it would be 
difficult to understand what the big picture issues are and how the data is collected. The mathematical skills, knowledge of programming 
languages, and data visualisation skills would help them to take the data and form it into something that easily repeatable and digestible. 
The communication skills are important for ensuring that the results reach who they need to and make an impact in the areas where they 
would be most useful.  

Data science is a newer field that is still being defined, while statistics has been around for longer. Both data scientists and 
statisticians use historical data to create forecasts of trends to inform stakeholders. However, statisticians work mostly with smaller 
and tidier datasets while data scientists with complex datasets that usually require more "cleansing". Because of this data scientists 
also work on creating automated ways for collecting data and implementing it into analysis. I am still early in my career and learning a 
lot as I go, but from where I stand now I believe being a data scientist will help me more in my career field. I say this because 
understanding how to clean up data into a form for analysis is more useful, and efficiency is important for applying towards real-world 
issues.
