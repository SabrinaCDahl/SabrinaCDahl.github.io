Hello, My name is Sabrina Dahl.  

I completed my ungrad at Virginia Tech (*Go Hokies!*) and I am currently completing a graduate certificate through North Carolina State University (*Go Wolfpack!*). One of my strengths is my attention to detail and I genuinely enjoy the feeling of figuring out a difficult piece of code.

My current class focuses on the programming language R. I hope this will help as I continue my career working within the natural scinces. Please enjoy this journey as I continue my education in Statistics and Data Management.
